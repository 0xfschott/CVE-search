# CVE-search

CVE search can be used to search the NIST database for CVEs and output them in different formats. Thereby, the script can be used with the exact CPE of a product or via "free" search.
The following example shows the usage via free search with `gitlab 16.8`:
```
> python3 .\cve_search.py -k "gitlab 16.8" -f markdown
Found multiple CPEs matching the keyword search.
(1) cpe:2.3:a:gitlab:gitlab:16.8.0:*:*:*:community:*:*:*
(2) cpe:2.3:a:gitlab:gitlab:16.8.0:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*
```

Two different cpes were found for the search term "gitlab 16.8" which can be selected by entering the index:
```
Select CPE:2

| CVE | Score | Description |
| --- | ----- | ----------- |
| CVE-2024-0402 | 9.9 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 16.0 prior to 16.6.6, 16.7 prior to 16.7.4, and 16.8 prior to 16.8.1 which allows an authenticated user to write files to arbitrary locations on the GitLab server while creating a workspace. |
| CVE-2023-6159 | 6.5 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 12.7 prior to 16.6.6, 16.7 prior to 16.7.4, and 16.8 prior to 16.8.1 It was possible for an attacker to trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service via a `Cargo.toml` containing maliciously crafted input. |
| CVE-2021-22201 | 6.5 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.9. A specially crafted import file could read files on the server. |
| CVE-2023-5933 | 5.4 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions after 13.7 before 16.6.6, 16.7 prior to 16.7.4, and 16.8 prior to 16.8.1. Improper input sanitization of user name allows arbitrary API PUT requests. |
| CVE-2021-22196 | 5.4 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.4. It was possible to exploit a stored cross-site-scripting in merge request via a specifically crafted branch name. |
| CVE-2023-5612 | 5.3 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions before 16.6.6, 16.7 prior to 16.7.4, and 16.8 prior to 16.8.1. It was possible to read the user email address via tags feed although the visibility in the user profile has been disabled. |
| CVE-2024-0456 | 4.3 | An authorization vulnerability exists in GitLab versions 14.0 prior to 16.6.6, 16.7 prior to 16.7.4, and 16.8 prior to 16.8.1. An unauthorized attacker is able to assign arbitrary users to MRs that they created within the project  |
| CVE-2021-22198 | 4.3 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 13.8 and above allowing an authenticated user to delete incident metric images of public projects. |
| CVE-2021-22197 | 4.3 | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 10.6 where an infinite loop exist when an authenticated user with specific rights access a MR having source and target branch pointing to each other |
| CVE-2021-32823 | 3.7 | In the bindata RubyGem before version 2.4.10 there is a potential denial-of-service vulnerability. In affected versions it is very slow for certain classes in BinData to be created. For example BinData::Bit100000, BinData::Bit100001, BinData::Bit100002, BinData::Bit<N>. In combination with <user_input>.constantize there is a potential for a CPU-based DoS. In version 2.4.10 bindata improved the creation time of Bits and Integers. |
